# DCTimer
DCTimer is a professional Python tool for synchronizing an attacker's system or process time with a Domain Controller (DC) or NTP server. It is designed for red team operations where precise time alignment is critical (e.g., Kerberos ticket forging, replay attacks). The tool is modular, robust, operator-friendly, and suitable for real-world use.
